Knockers was originally conceived back in June 2021 by Brad Anderson initially perceived as "DOR Code"(Dynamically Optimized Reference Code). In time he started development of it on firebasee and sought feedback on the concept of it with countless friends.

All code initially will have been written and compiled by Brad Anderson and is intended to be exclusively the main contributor at least for the initial future. In the event that Cub++ is launched other contributors may be considered.
